Description: This website is designed to showcase the restaurants' menu, services, and essential information for customers. It is a fully functional website with a clean interface and responsive layout to provide users with a smooth browsing experience.
  
Features: We have clear, sticky links for About, Menu, and Contact at the top.

A dedicated 'About Us' section that tells our history (starting in 2023) and explicitly mentions our unique blend of Filipino and popular Asian cuisine.

All the practical stuff is there: Opening Hours and the Physical Address are easy to find.

The 'Bogchi's Best! ⭐' section is perfect—it lets us highlight top sellers like the Kimchi Jiggae and Cajun Shrimp with great visuals.

Built in direct links for delivery via Food Panda.

There are clear icons and links to our social pages (Facebook and Instagram).

A simple link that takes users straight to Google Maps for directions to the restaurant.
